Emacs support for Snakemake
===========================

This repo contains two Emacs libraries for Snakemake [^1].

  * snakemake-mode.el provides a major mode for editing Snakemake
    files.

  * snakemake.el defines a popup interface for calling Snakemake.

See the header of each file for more information.

Both of these are available on MELPA under the snakemake-mode package:
